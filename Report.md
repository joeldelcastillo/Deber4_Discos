## Conclusions

    - What do you observe?
    - What are the main differences between the three drives?
    - What are the differences in performance when we change the value of `bs`?

- Why we see differences in performance for different values of `bs`?
- Try your experiments with `oflag=direct` and without it.
  - How do we explain the difference in performance of these two options?
